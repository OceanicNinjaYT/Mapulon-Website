            <h1 class="title">Under Fire: The Gendered Assault on Female Journalists in the Duterte Era</h1>
            <div class="subtitle">How misogynistic attacks threaten press freedom and democratic discourse</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="article-body">
            <p>As the trial of Former President Rodrigo Duterte unfolds in The Hague, online violence and misogynistic attacks against female journalists resurface—this time, its scope is amplified. This issue—a revival of the abhorrent misogyny echoed by FP Duterte and his supporters during his regime—not only emphasizes how fanaticism influences gender equality in the political landscape but also poses a fundamental threat to democracy, as discourse becomes overshadowed by intolerance and sexist perspectives.</p>

            <p>Following the announcement of Duterte's arrest, prominent female judges of the International Criminal Court (ICC) handling Duterte's pre-trial faced mockery and sexual remarks—an expression of collective outrage and apparent attempt to undermine their credibility and standing as women. Online profiles of Presiding Judge Iulia Motoc of the Pre-Trial Chamber on Facebook and LinkedIn were flooded with disparaging remarks regarding her physical appearance and authority as a part of the trial. The other judges were not spared by trolls and Duterte's supporters and were struck with racist comments.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, media journalists, including Maris Umali of GMA News, Zen Hernandez of ABS-CBN News, and Gretchen Ho of TV5, dealt with ridicule and defamatory claims. In Umali's instance, she was accused of making an insulting statement towards Former Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, claiming that she referred to him as "matanda." Umali personally addressed the issue on Facebook, stating that it was only a matter of being misheard. Coverage made by the women journalists was by "Haha" reactions on Facebook and sputtered by labels of "being biased" and "not credible" by netizens.</p>

            <p>Moreover, the online abuse faced by another journalist, Maria Ressa, has been deeply gendered and politically charged—rooted not only in her critical journalism but in her identity as a woman in a male-dominated political landscape. As the International Criminal Court proceeds with its investigation into Duterte's drug war, the resurgence of misogynistic attacks against women reflects a broader backlash. The former president's past public attacks on Ressa and Rappler—labelling them as criminals— enabled a surge of trolling and gender-based harassment that persists today. These attacks are not only a single occurrence but part of a pattern of authoritarian power that fluctuates to punish dissenting women, especially those exposing human rights violations.</p>

            <p>These occurrences of mockery are not just mere manifestations of rage from supporters; they all share a common denominator of launching gendered jabs against women. Gabriela Partylist Representative Arlene Brosas notes:</p>

            <div class="quote">
                Ginagamit ang misogyny at sexual harassment bilang sandata para patahimikin ang mga mamamahayag na nagsisikap na iparating ang katotohanan sa publiko. These attacks follow a familiar playbook—when powerful men feel threatened by factual reporting, they resort to gendered attacks to discredit women journalists.
            </div>

            <p>The wave of attacks aimed at female journalists has now brought light to the existing pattern of gender inequalities in correspondence—the act of undermining female media professionals' authority and ability by harassment and intimidation. The misogynistic oppression and bullying of female reporters like Zen Hernandez, Mariz Umali, and Gretchen Zo has raised concerns and the disturbing idea of utilizing coordinated attacks to silence critical reporting. This situation not only implies the existence of sexism within the field of journalism but also an attempt at compromising press freedom and accountability. The online community, media organizations, and government agencies must work together to establish protective measures and create a safe space for journalists, particularly for female journalists who face targeted threats. If action is not taken, the oppression of female voices continues, and the foundation of democratic discourse will start to shake. Protecting these women who risk everything for the public good is paramount, as it means protecting our freedom and beliefs in journalism and democracy itself.</p>
